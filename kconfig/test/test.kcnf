    This is the definition of a SHAVE application, named pp_gauss. The custom
    kconfig system will automatically generate entries for it. It'll also
    generate a sub-menu for the SHAVE placement where you'll be presented with
    a series of check-boxes corresponding to the selected platform SHAVE
    core-count. TODO: add a shavecorecount attribute to shaveapp entry
