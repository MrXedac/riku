  "body": "# The Riku Operating System \r\nThe Riku Operating System is a home-made, hobby operating system for Intel x64 architectures.\r\n\r\nIt is divided into two main components :\r\n- loader, which is the x86 bootstrap code,\r\n- kern, which is the x64 kernel code.\r\n\r\nRight now, Riku isn't ready for an everyday use, or even a real-hardware boot. This should happen in the future, or at least I hope it does!\r\n\r\n# Required stuff\r\nIn order to compile and run Riku, some standard development environment is required :\r\n- x86_64-elf-gcc toolchain (mandatory)\r\n- grub2 (grub-mkrescue to be honest, to generate the riku.iso bootable image)\r\n- nasm (my favourite assembler)\r\n- qemu-system-x86_64 (a virtual machine to run the kernel on is always a good thing)\r\n- GNU make (yep)\r\n- Tons of coffee (don't tell me you don't need this, I won't believe you)\r\n\r\nAlso, I know the Makefile are still a bit crappy, but I'm too lazy to do a clean thing. Feel free to make it cleaner by contributing!\r\n\r\n# What is done\r\nRight now, Riku can initialize some CPU-related components, as well as a graphical terminal (using QEMU's BGA adapter) :\r\n- x86 to x64 switch\r\n- Segment descriptors (GDT)\r\n- Interrupt management (IDT)\r\n- MMU configuration\r\n- Heap management\r\n\r\n# What's next\r\nThese are a few functionalities which should be added in the few next commits :\r\n- Threading (kernel tasks)\r\n- Driver model\r\n- Hardware probe and driver initialization\r\n- Virtual filesystem\r\n- System call interface\r\n- Userland binaries\r\n- Real filesystem\r\n- And a lot more...\r\n\r\n# Some words about Riku\r\nKeep in mind that Riku is a hobby kernel, which means its development cycle is slow, and that the source code might be buggy as hell. This is a personal project with educational purposes, so even if I hope I'll finish it one day, it will probably never be as stable and usable as a commercial OS. \r\n\r\nThat being said, don't hesitate to contribute to the project, that would really be helpful!",
